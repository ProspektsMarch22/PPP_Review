# PPP_Review

## Repository containing suggested answers for all exercises related to the Procedural Programming Paradigms (PPP)classes from spring 2024 at University of Coimbra. You must have your own exercise sheets, since this repository don't provide them, as we want to avoid problems with the uni.

# Naming Convention

The files use a name convention according to their listed numbers in the exercise sheets. For example, the exercise 9.2.2, will be named as tpc_922.c. 

If the suggested answer has header files, then all the files regarding that exercise will be at a nested directory. 

Such as the name convention for the main program relates it to the listed number of the exercise, the header and additional files, if they exist, will have a naming convention of their own. Following the above example, they will be addressed as tpc_922_header.h and tpc_922_header.c, to the header and function files, respectively.

# What this repository have

* It has a working answer to the exercised associated with each file
* The answers are peer-reviewed by other UC students.
* In case there are multiple ways to solve an exercise, there'll be additional files (numbered, i.e tpc_922_1.c)

# What this repository haven't

* Test answers
* Support from the UC
* People with patience working in it
* Any portuguese people working in it, except Rodrigo, but he counts only as half portuguese.
